Use web-debug skill with multiple parallel agents to validate https://dashboard.adverant.ai/dashboard/ee-design/ideation and https://dashboard.adverant.ai/dashboard/ee-design/projects pages. Use console code injection as primary validation method. Test: 1) No JavaScript errors on page load 2) All API calls succeed (check Network tab) 3) WebSocket connections work 4) All buttons/interactions function 5) Data loads from real APIs (not mock) 6) Zustand store state is properly initialized. Use ultrathinking mode for thorough analysis.
