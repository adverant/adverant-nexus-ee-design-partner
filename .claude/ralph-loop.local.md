200 Generate a fully functional professional schematic for the LLM enabled 200A FOC ESC Controller with proper component symbology from KiCad libraries, accurate wire routing following IPC-2221/IEEE 315 standards, proper spacing (min 300mil between ICs), correct labeling (IEC 60750/IEEE 315 reference designators), and all professional schematic best practices. Test by: 1) Generating schematic via UI, 2) Verifying KiCanvas shows real components (not 0 components), 3) Checking wire connections, 4) Validating layout follows signal flow (left-to-right). Exit criteria: Schematic displays with real symbols, proper wires, and passes all validation checks.
